Sure-Shot Theory:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using classes and objects.
An Account class represents a real-world bank account with attributes like account number, account holder name, and balance.
Methods such as deposit() and withdraw() are used to modify the balance with proper validation.
OOP improves code reusability, security, and maintainability.
